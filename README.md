# Introduction
Contains all of my reports on the practicum "Database System" of my undergraduate education in Brawijaya University (third semester, 2016). The reports are in Indonesian languange. As I have finished my undergraduate education, I am free from the obligation to keep my work to myself so that juniors can't copy my work. 
The database languange we used was SQL, and we used Microsoft SQL Studio to implement the database. During our study of databases, we are required to accomplish tasks and assignments. Those tasks and assignments are in the form of reports, and each chapter discusses certain topics and concepts related to database.
I thank FRISKA ANGGIA NURLITA SARI, FIDIA ROSIANTI, ADHIRAJASA RAITSANY, and TUTI WARDANI HAMID for being pretty cool practicum assistants and thus helped me to understood the SQL languange. Will update this when I found their GitHub accounts.

##How does this repo is structured?
The repo consists of my works on the Database System practicum. All of my works can be found inside the reports. There are a total of 12 reports, each represents a chapter ("bab"), and each of the chapters cover some topics:
1. Chapter 0: Explanation of the working environment of the practicum, and how to set it.
2. Chapter 1: ERD, EERD, and relational model mapping.
3. Chapter 2: Data Definition Languange (DDL) implementation and exercises.
4. Chapter 3: SQL SELECT Queries.
5. Chapter 4: Data Manipulation Languange (DML) implementation and exercises.
6. Chapter 5: Table Joins.
7. Chapter 6: SQL Operators.
8. Chapter 7: Column Function and Grouping.
9. Chapter 8: Union, Intersection, and Difference.
10. Chapter 9: SQL Subquery.
11. Chapter 10: SQL Transactions.
12. Chapter 11: T-SQL Programming Basics.
The reports itself contains SQL syntaxes that answers various questions based on each chapter. The SQL syntaxes are shown as screenshots. However, currently those questions are lost so I am unable to show it.
Hopefully this can show that I have past experience working with SQL databases (half of my projects utilized the SQL, but recently I found satisfaction in using NoSQL databases).
